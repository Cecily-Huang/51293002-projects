# Project 1: Hurricane Study
============================
## Overview
-----------
This project will focus on loops and strings.

Hurricanes often count among the worst natural disasters, both in terms of monetary costs and, more importantly, human life. Data Science can help us better understand these storms.

For this project, you'll be analyzing data in the hurricanes.csv file.

To start, download project.py, test.py and hurricanes.csv. You'll do your work in Jupyter Notebooks, producing a hurricane.ipynb file. You can test your code by running python test.py to test a main.ipynb file (or python test.py other.ipynb to test a notebook with a different name). If needed, you may only use standard Python modules such as math. 

This project consists of writing code to answer 20 questions. If you're answering a particular question in a cell in your notebook, you need to put a comment in the cell so I know what you're answering. For example, if you're answering question 10, the first line of your cell should contain #Q10.

## Questions and Functions
--------------------------
For the first three questions, you don't have to define any functions of your own. Instead you should just make use of the functions provided in the file project.py by calling the corresponding function that you need to solve a particular problem.

### Q1: How many records are in the dataset?

### Q2: What is the name of the hurricane at the second to last index?

### Q3: How many deaths were caused by the hurricane at index 24?

### Q4: How many hurricanes named Florence (case insensitive) are in the dataset?

### Q5: What is the number of unique deaths in the dataset?

### Q6: What is the name of the fastest hurricane?

### Q7: What is the average MPH achieved by all hurricanes?

### Q8: What is the average damage (in dollars) caused by all hurricanes?

### Q9: How many deaths did hurricane 'Floyd' cause in total?

### Q10: What is the deadliest hurricane between 2000 and 2020 (inclusive)?
